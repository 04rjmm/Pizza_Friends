# Pizza_Friends

I have created a website for a made up pizza restaurant, Pizza Friends. It has a landing page, about page, menu, booking form and contact page. The styling has been done with CSS and I have used Java Script to do the following:
- Change the inner HTML of the prices depending on which button you click on the menu
- Prevent the date field on the booking form from having a date in the past entered.
